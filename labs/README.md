# Labs

At the current time of writing there is just "lab" and not "labs." Each lab will have (broadly speaking) three parts:

1. A question, e.g. "how do I do X?"
1. A tutorial demonstrating the answer and justifications
1. A "further experimentation section"

The first two parts are meant to give you some hands-on experience with a "happy path" where everything should just work. Further experimentations is where you get to take what you've learned and begin probing the different ways that jobspec files can be configured. Arguably this is the most valuable part of the lab and where the most time should be spent; the first two parts are to provide context for this experimentation.
